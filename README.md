💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
An intelligent system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time using machine learning, designed to address one of the most critical challenges in the financial industry: accurately identifying rare and sophisticated fraud attempts in massive transaction datasets.

⚡ Why This Project Matters
In real-world banking, fraudulent transactions make up less than 0.2% of all activity, yet the financial losses are significant. This project demonstrates how advanced algorithms, thoughtful data preprocessing, and imbalance handling can elevate fraud detection accuracy without sacrificing real-time performance.

🧠 Key Highlights
✅ Real-time transaction fraud detection simulation
✅ Advanced handling of extreme class imbalance with SMOTE
✅ Feature scaling for improved model performance
✅ Powerful XGBoost classifier optimized for rare-event detection
✅ Comprehensive evaluation using ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and F1-score
✅ Clean, modular, production-ready code
